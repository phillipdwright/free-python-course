# Introduction to Data Types

While programming, you will be storing and manipulating lots of data. But where does it all go?

Data is stored in something called a variable. When creating a variable, you give it a name and then tell it what will be stored in it. Like this:

```
favorite_number = 12
```

You will encounter several different data types. The 3 most common types are integers, floats, and strings.

Integers are whole numbers like `12`.

Floats are decimal point numbers like `12.0`.

Strings are text like `howdy` or `My favorite number is 12`. Note you can use numbers inside strings.


You will use these a lot, so take the time to do the reading below to make sure you are comfortable with them. :)
