# Intro to Control Flow

As we've seen in class, our algorithms are just a set of rules that instruct the computer to do something. We're commanding the computer on what to do. But these algorithms won't be linear, there will be different "paths" to take. The most common example is the introduction of **_conditionals_**. Conditionals, or simply put, **_if statements_** let us make decisions in our algorithms. Examples:

* If the user's age is less than 16, don't allow the registration.
* If the purchase is greater than $1000 check for fraud.

The general form of an IF statement in Python is as follows:

```python
if [CONDITION]:
    # do something
    # (Condition True path)
else:
    # do something else
    # (Condition False path)
```

In our previous example, the `[CONDITION]` is what will make you decide between a path or the other. If the condition evaluates to True the, "True" path is taken. If the condition is NOT True (it's False) the "False" path is taken.

The condition for your if statements will be formed with a combination of data and boolean operators. For example, these are all valid conditions:

* `user_age > 16`
* `purchase_total > 1000`
* `user_is_active and date_registered < today`

There are many boolean operators, like:

* `>`: Greater than
* `<`: Less than
* `==`: Equals
* `>=`: Greater or equals than
* `<=`: Less or equals than

We also have operators that "combine" other operations. Like `and` or `or`. And finally we have the `not` operator, that just inverts the given value provided.

## Reading material

A good resource to find a comprehensive explanation of the if statement is [A Byte of Python's chapter about control flow](https://python.swaroopch.com/control_flow.html#the-if-statement).

[Chapter 2 from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/) has a longer explanation that covers **in detail** Python boolean operators and if statements.

**IMPORTANT:** We're not dealing with loops yet. You're not _supposed_ to read about them yet. If you still want to read about them, don't worry if you don't understand them completely. We'll explain them carefully in class.
